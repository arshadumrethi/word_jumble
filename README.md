# word_jumble
Word Jumble Web App in JavaScript (Vanilla) - Not a fancy webApp but a very functional one!

The concept is simple:
The user selects a difficulty level, based on which a word is randomly selected, jumbled and then displayed
to the user to unjumble. 

List of features I'd like to add to the game: 
1.) Shuffle Again - Shuffles the jumbled word again.
2.) Timer - Sets a time limit and displays time left.
3.) Points System
